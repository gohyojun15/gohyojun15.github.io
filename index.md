## About Me

I am a PhD student at the [Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing](https://prs.igp.ethz.ch/) in ETH Zurich collaborating with Google, under the supervision of Prof. [Konrad Schindler](https://prs.igp.ethz.ch/group/people/person-detail.schindler.html) and Dr. [Federico Tombari](https://federicotombari.github.io/). I am also advised by Dr. [Goutam Bhat](https://goutamgmb.github.io/) and Dr. [Prune Truong](https://prunetruong.com/) from Google. My research interests include generative models (especially Diffusion Models) and 3D generation.


I worked as a Research Scientist for my mandatory military service in Twelvelabs and Riiid (Korean military service companies).
Prior that, I received my M.S. degree from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).

## Research Interests

- **3D Generation:** My ultimate research goal is to generate and edit immerse 3D and
4D world scenes. Based on the power of generative models, inducing the sceneâ€™s geometry prior,
representation, and physics to them is aligned with my research interest. This reflects my publications on 3D aware generation: [ICCV 2025 (1)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15855), [ICCV 2025 (2)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12024), [CVPR2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16443), [TPAMI 2024](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tp/5555/01/10475596/1VrCLjNNgfS), [CVPR 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15980)

- **Diffusion Models:** I think that diffusion models inherently take a multi-task learning, where a single model learns multiple denoising tasks across different noise levels. If we can harmoniously train a model with these tasks, I believe that the model can generate high-quality samples with small computational resources (parameters). Please check out our papers on [NeurIPS 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00354), [ICLR 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07138), [ECCV 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09176), [CVPR 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05973), [AAAI 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04990), [AAAI 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17825), and [ICLR 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10348)

<!-- - **Video Understanding:** In addition, I am interested in advancing Video Language Models for improved video understanding. [Pegasus Tech Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14687) -->
