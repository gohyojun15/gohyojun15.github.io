## About Me

I am a Research Scientist at Twelvelabs Video Language Model team. I received my M.S. degree from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2022, advised by Prof. [Changick Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ABH_2lcAAAAJ). 
My research interests include generative models (especially Diffusion Models), 3D generation, and video understanding.

## Research Interests

- **Diffusion Models:** I think that diffusion models inherently take a multi-task learning, where a single model learns multiple denoising tasks across different noise levels. If we can harmoniously train a model with these tasks, I believe that the model can generate high-quality samples with small computational resources (parameters). Please check out our papers on [NeurIPS 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00354), [ICLR 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07138), [ECCV 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09176), [CVPR 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05973), and [AAAI 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04990).
- **3D Generation:** With Diffusion Models, I am also interested in 3D generation such as Multi-View Image Generation and 3D Gaussian Splatting Generation.
- **Video Understanding:** In addition, I am interested in advancing Video Language Models for improved video understanding.
